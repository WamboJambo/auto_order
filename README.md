### TODO:
- Make account page, to link Auto Order accounts to their (fake) Capital One bank accounts
- Create some form of API for food services in the area (pizza/sandwich places, etc.)
- Add extra features (voice menu ordering, TTS, anything to make the UX better)
- Fix front-end issue (website looks terrible)
